- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lolbanoori, or better known as "Banoori".
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AR/VR, and the Metaverse in particular. I have this dream of widespread adoption of AR/VR headsets, but of course keeping in mind the human costs it brings.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GameDev on Unity3D and 3D Modelling on Blender. Also completed a few related courses on Coursera.
- ðŸ“« I'm on Instagram as @realbanoori. More formally, banoorizohair@gmail.com is the way to go.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Ready Player One can be very real in the near future ;)
